# **Definitions**

## SIM - Subscriber Identity Module
---
- Identifies/authenticates the subscriber to the network
- Provides storage for subscriber (contacts etc.)
- Contains a micro-processor (i.e. can perform calculations)
- Holds a number of data files containing data relating to operation of the mobile equipment


## ICCID - Integrated Circuit Card Identifier
---
- ICCID uniquely identifies the card
- 19 or 20 digits in length 
- Always stored digitally in the card
- Cannot be edited on a normal SIM
- Often printed on the outside
- Can determine issuing service provider & country from ICCID

## IMSI - International Mobile Subscriber Identity
---
- IMSI uniquely identifies a subscriber
- 15 digits in length
- Always stored digitally on the card
- Cannot be edited on a normal SIM
- Seldom seen by, or known to, the owner
- Can also determine the issuing service provider & country from the IMSI
- Reveals name and country of issuing service provider

## MSISDN - Mobile Station Integrated Services Digital Network
---
- a.k.a the mobile telephone number!
- Stored on the SIM card as “Own Dialling Number”
- BUT is user-editable and hence unreliable
- Only reliable source is service provider
- UK mobile numbers start “07” / MRU starts with "+230 5"
- Length of MSISDN is country specific (max 15)

## SIM Card Evidence
---
1.	Note the number printed on the card
2.	Count how many digits it contains
3.	Use the findings of other students to complete the table below for the most common service providers in the UK
4.	Copy the findings from other students

| Service Provider. | Total number of digits printed on the card. | First 6 digits printed on the card. |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| -                 | -                                           | -                                   |
